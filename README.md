# OCABS is now inside OScar

All the features of OCABS, __except for enhanced CAMs__, are now integrated into the CA Basic Service module of OScar, our open implementation of the ETSI C-ITS stack.
You can find more information on OScar [OpenWrt-V2X](https://github.com/DriveX-devs/OScar).

Therefore, OCABS is no longer going to be maintained with the exclusion of the enhanced CAM features. The latter are going to be maintained as part of this repository, until they will be integrated into OScar.

# OCABS - the Open CA Basic Service implementation

This repository contains _OCABS_, a C++ open implementation of the CA Basic Service, to be used for deployement into real hardware, running, for instance, [OpenWrt-V2X](https://github.com/francescoraves483/OpenWrt-V2X).

This project includes a full open source implementation of the **ETSI CA Basic Service**, with reference to the standard [ETSI EN 302 637-2 V1.4.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302600_302699/30263702/01.04.01_60/en_30263702v010401p.pdf), including the **BTP** and **GeoNetworking** layers. CAMs **version 2** are currently being managed (there is no official support for the older CAMs version 1).

As the project is still work-in-progress, it currently provides only the dissemination of CAMs, while the reception of the same messages should be managed by any other V2X service requiring the reception of CAMs.

**Important**: OCABS needs a source of PVT (Position-Velocity-Time) GNSS data through `gpsd`. Thus, a GNSS device must be available (either real, or emulated, for instance thanks to tools like `gpsfake`) and it must be connected to a `gpsd` instance.

The OCABS main help, with all the possibile options, can be displayed with `./OCABS --help`, after compiling the OCABS binary.

OCABS also supports a proposed enhancement to CAM messages (i.e., the [Enhanced CAMs](https://github.com/francescoraves483/EnhancedCAMs-asn1)), to be used in conjunction with the [AIM Local Dynamic Map](https://github.com/francescoraves483/AIM-AutomotiveIntegratedMap). The transmission of the enhanced messages may break compatibility with other existing standard-compliant stacks (e.g., the Cohda Wireless stack, the [ms-van3t](https://github.com/marcomali/ms-van3t) stack in emulation mode), and it is thus enabled only when explicitly specified through the option `--enable-enhanced-CAMs` (or, in short, `-E`) . If not enabled, standard-compliant version 2 CAMs are sent, without any modification.

When enhanced CAMs are **not** enabled, the following options (and the corresponding short versions) are **no longer** valid and thus should not be specified: `--own-public-ip`, `--own-private-ip`, `--extra-comp-dev-ip`, `--rssi-aux-update-interval`, `--aux-dev-ip`.

# Compiling OCABS

OCABS can be easily compiled on the same device in which it will be run thanks to `make`.

As the only pre-requisite, `libgps-dev` must be installed and available.

To download and build the latest version of OCABS, first, clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/francescoraves483/OCABS-project
``` 
Then, `cd` into the newly created directory:
```
cd OCABS-project
```
Finally, build OCABS:
```
make
```

The OCABS binary file will be called `OCABS`.

Then, make sure that a GNSS data provider is active and `gpsd` is running (you can use the `gpsmon` tool to check if GNSS PVT data is actively being received).

You can then launch OCABS with (a stationID should be specified all the times with the `--vehicle-id` option):
```
./OCABS --vehicle-id <unsigned 32-bit integer stationID> --gnss-device <IP or URL of the device where gpsd is being run - usually localhost/127.0.0.1> --gnss-port <port to use for the connection to gpsd> --interface <interface from which CAMs will be disseminated>
```

If you get a permission denied error (as OCABS is internally using *raw sockets*), you can try launching again OCABS with `sudo` or from the `root` user.

# Cross-compiling OCABS for OpenWrt

OCABS is also though to be easily cross-compiled for any embedded platform or router running OpenWrt.

Cross-compilation also leverages `make`. However, it requires a few additional steps, after cloning the repository.

First of all, an OpenWrt toolchain must be available in the device used for cross-compilation, with the `PATH` and `STAGING_DIR` environment variables being properly set. You can find additional information on how to set up the OpenWrt toolchain [here](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/crosscompile). When performing the build procedure steps, select the `libgps` package with `make menuconfig`.

Then, open the OCABS `Makefile` and update lines 3 and 4 (this needs to be done only once per development PC):
- Line 3 (`OPENWRT_STAGING_DIR`) should be updated to point to the directory where the OpenWrt toolchain `./usr/include` is located (you can start from the already available path to properly update this line)
- Line 4 (`OPENWRT_LIBGPS_VER`) should be updated with the libgps version which came with the OpenWrt toolchain installation (currently, it should be kept to `3.23`, but it may change in the future)

After performing these modifications, `cd` into the OCABS project main directory:
```
cd OCABS-project
```
Finally, build OCABS with the `compileAPU` target:
```
make compileAPU
```
As in the previous case, a binary file named `OCABS` will be generated. The executable can be then transferred to the device running OpenWrt and launched with:
```
./OCABS --vehicle-id <unsigned 32-bit integer stationID> --gnss-device <IP or URL of the device where gpsd is being run - usually localhost/127.0.0.1> --gnss-port <port to use for the connection to gpsd> --interface <interface from which CAMs will be disseminated>
``` 

You can also make OCABS run as a service, by creating two new files inside OpenWrt: 
- `/etc/init.d/OCABS`, to create a new service
- `/etc/config/OCABS`, to configure the OCABS service

A sample of the two files is reported below:

## `/etc/init.d/OCABS` sample

This sample shows how to create the OCABS service through an `init.d` script. More details are available [here](https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/initscripts) and [here](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/procd-init-script-example).

For a basic working service setup (without Enhanced CAMs), you can freely copy the whole content reported below. This sample `init.d` assumes that the OCABS executable has been placed inside a directory named `/root/OCABS` (see the `procd_set_param command` line).

```
#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
 
USE_PROCD=1
 
START=99
STOP=01
 
CONFIGURATION=OCABS
 
start_service() {
    # Reading configuration parameters (i.e. interface and port)
    config_load "${CONFIGURATION}"
    local name
    local every
 
    config_get interface OCABS interface
	config_get gnssport OCABS gnssport
	config_get vehicleID OCABS vehicleID
	config_get gpsdaddress OCABS gpsdaddress
 
    procd_open_instance
 
    # pass config to script on start
    procd_set_param command /bin/bash -c "cd /root/OCABS && ./OCABS --interface $interface --gnss-port $gnssport --vehicle-id $vehicleID --gnss-device $gpsdaddress"
    procd_set_param file /etc/config/OCABS
    procd_set_param stdout 1
    procd_set_param stderr 1
	procd_set_param respawn ${respawn_threshold:-3600} ${respawn_timeout:-60} ${respawn_retry:-0}
    procd_close_instance
}
```

## `/etc/config/OCABS` sample

This sample shows how to create an OCABS configuration file, after setting up the proper `init.d` script.

The configuration file options should match the ones reported in the `config_get` lines of the `init.d` script.

```
config myservice 'OCABS'
	option interface 'wlan1'
	option gnssport '2947'
	option vehicleID '3000112'
	option gpsdaddress '127.0.0.1'
```

In general, this sample allows the user to set the dissemination interface (`interface` option), the gpsd service address (`gpsdaddress` option), to retrieve the PVT data from, the port at which the gpsd address is available (`gnssport` option) and the device station ID (`vehicleID` option). This sample is related to an OCABS service set to disseminate non-Enhanced CAMs only.

## Starting and stopping the OpenWrt service

After setting up the OCABS OpenWrt service, you can start it with:
```
service OCABS start
```
And stop it with:
```
service OCABS stop
```
The service can also be enabled to run at start-up with:
```
service OCABS enable
```
The execution at start-up can be disabled, instead, with:
```
service OCABS disable
```

When running as a service, the output of OCABS is not directly available, but it can be retrieved with:
```
logread
```
